The C# language provides a handy way to declare, subscribe to and fire events.
Technically, an event is a "slot" where callback functions (event handlers) can
be attached to - a process referred to as subscribing to an event. Here is
a handy package that encapsulates the core to event subscription and event
firing and feels like a "natural" part of the language.

.. code-block:: pycon
 
    >>> def something_changed(reason): 
    ...     print "something changed because %s" % reason 
    ...

    >>> from events import Events
    >>> events = Events()
    >>> events.on_change += something_changed

Multiple callback functions can subscribe to the same event. When the event is
fired, all attached event handlers are invoked in sequence. To fire the event,
perform a call on the slot: 

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> events.on_change('it had to happen')
    'something changed because it had to happen'
